					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that dark patterns in UX Design refers to how designers will design 
							in a certain way to trick the consumer into purchasing a product or service, or 
							convey a meaning that might not be true. I've always been aware of this, but never 
							realized that sometimes its completely intentional. For example, sometimes products/services will
							claim to be "free", then add a line with small font underneath (or somewhere unnoticeable) 
							that includes extra costs. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article is highlighting the "Roach Motel"
							design because it is very apparent in a lot of services/products that we use.
							Amazon is a great example, where the company makes it extremely difficult to delete 
							your account. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage
						 of it by making a page look like it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another." </p>
					</li>
