						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that choosing the right font is just as important for conveying the branding/messaging
								of a company as other components such as color, visual hierarchy, etc. For example, more formal-looking
								fonts convey professionality, while rounder and bubbly fonts tend to be more playful. Something I found 
								interesting was that when choosing a font, it's important to consider your audience.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was definitely the plethora of font resources the website provided.
								Not only are there websites for font inspiration, there are also sites that help you find the perfect 
								font to pair with, as well as the perfect ratio of sizing fonts. </p>
