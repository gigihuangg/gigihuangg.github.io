                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article is that there are infinite ways to incorporate interactions and 
                                animations into UX Design. These small interactions adds so much fun to the overall user experience,
                                even if its something as minute as sending a payment to another person.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I have a lot of favorites out of all the examples! One of my favorites is the Nike shoe shopping app, I am
                                obsessed with how the physical size of the shoe changes as you select your shoe size, as well as changing 
                                the shoe's color upon tapping on different colors. I am also in love with the welcome screen of the "Story" app,
                                the way it transitions to the log in page is so cool.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> What I said above! </p>
