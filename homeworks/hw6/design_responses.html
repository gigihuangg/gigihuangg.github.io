						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are many different components in designing animations
								in UX. Specifically, there are principles in easing motion, depending on 
								the kind of content you are trying to display. For example, when showing a 
								list of content, like emails, it's best to display them in equal interaction, 
								as opposed to one by one. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is definitely the small animation examples
								they included. It really helps me visualize the content as well as seeing good 
								and bad examples of motion design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
