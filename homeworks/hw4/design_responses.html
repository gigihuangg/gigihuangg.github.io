						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something new I learned from this article was that when making charts and graphs more accessible, 
								you can add different textures instead of just changing colors. For people with color blindness or 
								other visual disabilbiites, it may be hard to distinguish between colors. Thus, using patterns is 
								a much more accessible way to display data. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was realizing that things I've seen on websites quite often are
								actually designed with intention. For example, if a user filled out a text area wrong, there will 
								usually be a short description stating why your input is invalid. This is something that I never 
								paid attention to but it makes a world of a difference for user experience. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Accounting for accessibility early on in a product’s life cycle is 
								best—it reduces the time and money you’ll spend to make your products 
								accessible retroactively."</p>
						</li>
