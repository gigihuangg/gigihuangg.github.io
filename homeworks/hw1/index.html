        <h3>Reading Responses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned that every app and user interface I interact with on a daily basis is designed with intent. For example,
                in Airbnb's search bar, it says "Try London" instead of simply "Search". This gives users a sense of excitement and curiousity 
                to exploring places, instead of having the user think of specific locations.
            </li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article is the breakdown of different popular app interfaces, such as Airbnb, Twitter and Spotify.
                It was eye opening to see that there was so much thought put behind each interface in the apps I use daily.

                "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."

            <li>I rate this article a 7/10.</li>
