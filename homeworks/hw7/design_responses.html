					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the Gestalt principles can be applied to UX Design as well.
								My previous understanding of the Gestalt principles was used primarily in 
							art and psychology (analyzing your personality/mindset based on what you see first).
							Seeing the Gestalt principles applied to UX is very interesting! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is seeing popular logos applying the Gestalt principles. 
								For example, I never realized that the Panda Express logo utilized the principle
							of reification. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays 
								in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets your design
								 creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is sharing?”</p>
						</li>
